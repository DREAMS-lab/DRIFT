### Description
This program's purpose is to watch over the `crashes` folder directory which
is depicted inside of the shellphuzz program environment work directory. 
From this current directory, it will be in: `../arena/workdir/fuzzer-master/crashes/`.
If there are any files other than the README.txt file, it will then move these
to the regression testing directory and push to github.
