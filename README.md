The Drone Research Integrated Fuzzing Tool (DRIFT) Sponsored by the ASU DREAMS Lab. 

## Abstract 

Itâ€™s common knowledge that emerging technologies have played a central role in the modern world; one of these emerging technologies is autonomous drones and robotics. The introduction of automated robotics applications across the globe has spurred a need for secure systems. As more autonomous systems are introduced into high-risk jobs, we need a reusable and scalable method to make autonomous systems more secure and reliable. DRIFT is the implementation of both a GUI and CI approach to increasing security in automated robotics through Fuzzing, a recent development in systems security to improve automated bug discovery.
