The Drone Research Integrated Fuzzing Tool (DRIFT) Sponsored by the [ASU DREAMS Lab](https://web.asu.edu/jdas/home). 

## Abstract 

Itâ€™s common knowledge that emerging technologies have played a central role in the modern world; one of these emerging technologies is [autonomous drones and robotics](https://www.ros.org/). The introduction of automated robotics applications across the globe has spurred a need for secure systems. As more autonomous systems are introduced into high-risk jobs, we need a reusable and scalable method to make autonomous systems more secure and reliable. 

DRIFT is the implementation of both a Guided User Interface (GUI) and a Continuous Integration (CI) approach to increasing security in automated robotics through [Fuzzing](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/fuzz-testing), a recent development in systems security to improve automated bug discovery.  

## Getting Started   
`drift` requires:
* Python 3.7+. (Python 2 is not supported)
* Docker
* A *decent* system (At least 4 Core processor, 16 GB of ram **Dedicated**)
  * Minimum specs == Minimum Performance
  * Can be run in the cloud on AWS (t2.2xlarge versed well)

`drift` can be installed as a module using pip and the `requirements.txt` file in the repository. 

### Installed as a Module
`drift` can be installed via `pip`:
```console
pip install --requirement requirements.txt
```
It can then be run directly
```console
drift -h # Example running the help command
```
**Note:** Even as a module, it is recommended to run the program from within the downloaded code directory. Folders such as `resources` is essential to the operation of some of the program's operation. 
**Note:** It is recommended to use a python virtual environment to install modules and keep  our environment clean. If you wish to do so, you will need [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) and the [pyenv-virtualenv plugin](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-virtualenv) before installing the module.

If you wish to have an easy install guide, follow the [install guide](#install_guide).

### Usage and Examples
```console
drift overwatch <regressionRepo>
drift cli <binary> <gitRepo> [--dictionary=DICT] [--args=ARGS] [--workdir=DIR] [--web] [--port=PORT]
drift web [-p | --port=PORT]
drift (-h | --help)

drift -h
drift cli chall.bin https://github.com/Pascal-0x90/Travis-Fuzz-Basic.git --web --port=80
drift overwatch git@github.com:Pascal-0x90/TestRepository.git
drift web -p 6969
```
#### Options
```console
-h --help                 Show this message.
--version                 Show the current version
--web                     Open a web server on PORT which shows
                        the current progress of the CLI.
--port=PORT               Define port number to host/attach.
                        to the WebGUI on. [default: 8888]
--dictionary=DICT         Define a path to a dictionary you
                        wish to use in the fuzzing proccess.
--args=ARGS               Define arguments to be sent to the
                        target being fuzzed. [default: @@]
--workdir=DIR             Define where the work directory
                        should be. [default: workdir]
```

```



### GUI
The GUI will allow you to start a fuzzing instance, or multiple instances, from within the interface.
First you need to build the GUI, which will take a few minutes to build the docker image.

```bash
(cd src/drift-ui; ./build)
```

After building the GUI it can be started locally in the `src/drift-ui` folder. It's important that you put any binary target you want inside the `src/drift-ui` before running:

```bash
(cd src/drift-ui; ./run)
```

Note that this run is based on your local directory, which must be `src/drift-ui`. You will now have GUI interface which will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8888`. Simply paste that address into your web browser of choice and enjoy. 

### CI

The CI is a little more complicated to setup, but can be more effective than the GUI. Note, the current implementation of DRIFT allows you to view the fuzzer progress in the CI through a remotely connected GUI specified earlier.
